JRuby web app:

Requires sinatra to run.

Requires sinatra, rack/test and rspec to run the tests.

Running tests requires running rspec manually.

You can automatically start the web app by running webrunner.sh. It will confirm that the tictactoe.jar exists. You
must then navigate to http://localhost:4567/ in your web browser.
